# Neural-Network-C-structure

With this structure, you will be able to create and use easily (or not...) a simple neural network.
It's probably not optimized as it should be. But, it works well for simple project as XOR problem or character recognition in images (OCR based projects).

A descritption of the code is coming soon...

Stay tuned !
